Instructions to run the code on your MacBook Pro M2:

1. **Open a text editor**:
   Open a text editor on your MacBook Pro M2 (e.g., TextEdit, Sublime Text, VSCode) and paste the provided code into a new file.

2. **Save the file**:
   Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `lotto_suggestion.py`.

3. **Open Terminal**:
   Open Terminal on your MacBook Pro M2. You can do this by searching for "Terminal" in Spotlight or navigating to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

4. **Navigate to the directory containing your Python script**:
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

5. **Install necessary libraries**:
   If you haven't installed the necessary libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) yet, you can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

6. **Run the script**:
   Once you're in the correct directory and have installed the necessary libraries, you can run the script by executing the following command in Terminal:

   python lotto_suggestion.py
   ```
   Replace `lotto_suggestion.py` with the name of your Python script if it's different.

7. **Interact with the GUI**:
   After running the script, a graphical user interface (GUI) window should appear. Click the "Generate Suggestion" button to generate suggested numbers for the next game. The suggested numbers will be displayed in the GUI window.
